## üì¶ Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/manirht/my-portfolio.git](https://github.com/manirht/my-portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-portfolio
    ```
3.  **Install core dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    # yarn install
    ```
4.  **Install React Icons:**
    ```bash
    npm install react-icons
    ```
5.  **Ensure your main CSS file (`src/index.css` or similar) contains your global styles:**
    ```css
    /* src/index.css */
    /* Define your custom CSS variables here for global use */
    :root {
      --bg-primary: #1a1a2e;
      --bg-secondary: #212a3e;
      --bg-tertiary: #2e3b55;
      --text-primary: #e0e0e0;
      --text-secondary: #a0a0a0;
      --accent-primary: #63b3ed;
      --accent-secondary: #e53e3e;
      --border-color: #4a5568;

      /* VS Code like colors for the code block */
      --vs-green: #4ec9b0;
      --vs-purple: #c586c0;
      --vs-yellow: #dcdcaa;
      --vs-orange: #ce9178;

      color: var(--text-primary);
    }
    ```
6.  **Ensure your main CSS file is imported in `src/main.jsx`:**
    ```javascript
    // src/main.jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import App from './App.jsx';
    import './index.css'; // Make sure this line is present

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
      </React.StrictMode>,
    );
    ```
7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
